This the begnining of a genome assembly pipeline, that uses multiple iterations to maximize how good the assembly is. Needs quite accurate data however.

a) needs function to take out poor base calls.\n
b) needs function to calculate approximate coverage.\b
c) needs function to approximate size of kmer ends based on approximate coverage.
